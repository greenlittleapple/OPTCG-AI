"""
Integration Test #2 â€“ Leader-vs-Leader attack (updated API).

Sequence (no extra card-selection clicks needed because `attack()` now
handles them internally):

P1 turn
--------
1. P1 leader attacks P2 leader            (MACROS.attack)
2. P2 resolves attack                     (click_action0)
3. End Turn                               (click_end_turn)

P2 turn
--------
4. P2 leader attacks P1 leader            (MACROS.attack)
5. P1 resolves attack                     (click_action0)
6. End Turn                               (click_end_turn)
